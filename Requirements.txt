Java AI Programming Project
Prerequisites
	•	Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher 
	•	Maven 3.6 or higher 
	•	Internet connection (for API calls) 
	•	Perplexity API key (for AI capabilities)  Setup Instructions  How to get Perplexity API key  Refer to this website guide : https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/getting-started  1. Set up the Perplexity API key  The application uses the Perplexity API, which requires an API key. You can set it up in one of these ways:  Option 1: Eclipse IDE 
	1	Right-click on MainApplication.java in the Package Explorer 
	2	Select "Run As" → "Run Configurations..." 
	3	In the Run Configurations dialog, select the "Environment" tab 
	4	Click "New..." button 
	5	Set "Name" to PERPLEXITY_API_KEY 
	6	Set "Value" to your actual API key 
	7	Click "OK" to save the environment variable 
	8	Click "Apply" then "Run" to launch the application 
Option 2: Environment Variable via Command Line
Set the PERPLEXITY_API_KEY environment variable: Windows:
set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
macOS/Linux:
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
2. Set up FreeTTS Library Files
  
For speech functionality, you need to set up the FreeTTS libraries:
	1	Locate the freetts folder provided with the project 
	2	In Eclipse, right-click on the project in the Package Explorer 
	3	Select "Properties" 
	4	Go to "Java Build Path" → "Libraries" tab 
	5	Delete/Remove All Exisiting JAR files under classpath and add them again. 
	6	Click "Add JARs..." or "Add External JARs..." button 
	7	Navigate to the project's freetts/lib folder 
	8	Select all JAR files in the lib folder 
	9	Click "Open" and then "Apply and Close" 
	10	The FreeTTS libraries should now be added to your project's classpath 
Option 2: Modify the code directly
If you can't set environment variables, you can modify the ChatController.java file:
	1	Open src/com/teamname/controller/ChatController.java 
	2	Locate the constructor where the API key is initialized (around line 70) 
	3	Replace: 
4. String apiKey = System.getenv("PERPLEXITY_API_KEY");
with:
String apiKey = "your_api_key_here";
3. Build and Run the project Using Eclipse IDE
1. Import the project into Eclipse: o Select "File" → "Import" → "Maven" → "Existing Maven Projects" o Browse to the project directory and click "Finish"
2. Build the project: o Right-click on the project in Package Explorer o Select "Run As" → "Maven build..." o Enter clean package in the Goals field o Click "Run"
3. Run the application: o Right-click on MainApplication.java in the Package Explorer o Select "Run As" → "Java Application"
The application uses several libraries:
	•	JavaFX - UI framework 
	•	RSyntaxTextArea - Syntax highlighting for code examples 
	•	iText PDF - PDF generation for conversation exports 
	•	Gson - JSON processing for API communication 
	•	SQLite JDBC - Local database storage 
	•	Ikonli - Font icons for the UI 
• FreeTTS - Text-to-speech capabilities All dependencies are managed through Maven and will be downloaded automatically
during the build process.
Using the Application
	1	Chat Interface: Type your questions about Java programming in the text area at the bottom 
	2	Voice Input/Output: Toggle voice input/output using the buttons above the text area 
	3	Priority Levels: Set message priority using the dropdown 
	4	Conversation Management: 
o Create new conversations with the "+ New Chat" button o Switch between conversations using the sidebar o Delete conversations by clicking the X next to the conversation title
	5	Export: Download conversations as PDF using the "Export PDF" button 
	6	Summarize: Generate AI summaries of conversations with the "Summarize" button 
Troubleshooting
Verifying Installation
When the application starts successfully: • You should see a GUI window with the title "AI Programming Tutor"
	•	If the API key is not set or invalid, the application will fall back to local, pre- programmed responses 
	•	Check the console output for API-related error messages Voice Capabilities 
	•	Voice input/output may not work on all systems due to dependencies 
	•	The application will show warnings if voice features are unavailable  Database Issues 
	•	If the database file becomes corrupted, delete the chat_history.db file and restart the application 
	•	The application will create a new database file automatically  Contact

✅Application started successfully"

	•	The console or terminal should display: " 
	•	If the API key is properly set, you'll see: "API key found. Length: XX"
